## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms**. I enjoy building small projects and improving my coding fundamentals step-by-step.

I am currently learning **web development** and exploring technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**. My goal is to develop a solid foundation before moving toward full-stack development.

I am also working on **Coding Playground**, a learning-focused platform that includes a real-time compiler and curated programming problems.

I believe in consistency, clean code, and continuous learning.
